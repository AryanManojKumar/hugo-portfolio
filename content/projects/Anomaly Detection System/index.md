### Key Capabilities

**Real-Time Video Analysis**
- Processes live video feeds and recorded streams using computer vision models  
- Detects anomalous activities and visual irregularities in near real time  

**Multi-Category Anomaly Detection**
- Supports multiple anomaly classes (e.g., suspicious behavior, crowd issues, safety risks)  
- Designed for large-scale surveillance and event monitoring scenarios  

**Severity Classification Pipeline**
- Five-level severity assessment (**Low → Emergency**)  
- Confidence scoring for each detected anomaly  
- Helps prioritize alerts and reduce false positives  

**Multi-Agent AI Architecture**
- Central orchestrator coordinates vision analysis, reasoning, and validation  
- Specialized agents handle detection, classification, and safety verification  
- Modular design allows easy extension with new anomaly types  

**Admin Dashboard & Event Management**
- Web-based admin panel for reviewing detected anomalies  
- Event tracking and incident categorization  
- Volunteer / responder assignment based on anomaly type and severity
