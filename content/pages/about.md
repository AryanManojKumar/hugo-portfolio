I’m a backend-focused software engineer with strong interest in building scalable, reliable systems.

Hugo makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

### What I work on
- Designing and building REST & API-driven backends
- AI-powered systems using LLMs and vision models
- Agent-based workflows and orchestration
- Performance, cost, and production constraints

### Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, Go, JavaScript
- **Backend:** REST APIs, background jobs, authentication
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB
- **AI/ML:** LLM APIs, image & video pipelines
- **Infra:** Docker, Linux, cloud deployment

I enjoy working close to real-world constraints—latency, cost, safety, and scale—and turning ideas into production-ready systems.
